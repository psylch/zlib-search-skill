# Book Tools

Search and download books from multiple sources through a unified CLI.

## Backends

| Backend | Source | Auth Required | Best For |
|---------|--------|---------------|----------|
| **zlib** | Z-Library (EAPI) | Email + Password | Largest catalog, direct download |
| **annas** | Anna's Archive | API Key (donation) | Aggregated sources, multiple mirrors |

## First-Time Setup

On first invocation, run the setup check and guide the user through configuration interactively.

### Step 1: Check Dependencies

```bash
bash ${SKILL_PATH}/scripts/setup.sh check
```

Output is key=value pairs. Check each:

| Key | OK | Missing Action |
|-----|----|----------------|
| `PYTHON` | `ok` | Python 3 not found — user must install it |
| `REQUESTS` | `ok` | Run `bash ${SKILL_PATH}/scripts/setup.sh install-deps` |
| `ANNAS_BINARY` | `ok` | Run `bash ${SKILL_PATH}/scripts/setup.sh install-annas` (optional) |

### Step 2: Configure Credentials

Credentials are stored in `~/.claude/book-tools/.env`. Create the file from the skill's bundled template:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/book-tools
cp ${SKILL_PATH}/scripts/.env.example ~/.claude/book-tools/.env
```

The `.env` file looks like this:

```
# Z-Library credentials
ZLIB_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
ZLIB_PASSWORD=your_password_here

# Anna's Archive (optional, requires donation for API key)
# ANNAS_SECRET_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT ask the user for credentials directly in chat. Instead:
1. Create the `.env` file (or `.env.example` template)
2. Tell the user to edit `~/.claude/book-tools/.env` with their credentials
3. Wait for the user to confirm they've filled it in
4. Then proceed with search

Alternatively, credentials can be set via CLI (less recommended — visible in shell history):

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_PATH}/scripts/book.py config set --zlib-email "user@mail.com" --zlib-password "password"
```

### Step 3: Verify

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_PATH}/scripts/book.py setup
```

Expected output when Z-Library is configured:
```json
{
  "zlib": { "requests_installed": true, "configured": true },
  "annas": { "binary_found": true, "api_key_configured": false }
}
```

If `configured` is `true`, the skill is ready to use.

### Credential Storage Details

Two sources are merged (`.env` values take priority):

| Source | Path | Format |
|--------|------|--------|
| `.env` file | `~/.claude/book-tools/.env` | `KEY=value` per line |
| Config JSON | `~/.claude/book-tools/config.json` | JSON (auto-managed) |

On first successful Z-Library login, remix tokens are cached in `config.json` — subsequent calls skip the email/password login and use tokens directly.

## Workflow

The typical flow is: **search → pick → download**.

### 1. Search

```bash
# Auto-detect backend (tries zlib first, then annas)
python3 ${SKILL_PATH}/scripts/book.py search "machine learning" --limit 10

# Z-Library with filters
python3 ${SKILL_PATH}/scripts/book.py search "deep learning" --source zlib --lang english --ext pdf --limit 5

# Anna's Archive
python3 ${SKILL_PATH}/scripts/book.py search "reinforcement learning" --source annas

# Chinese books
python3 ${SKILL_PATH}/scripts/book.py search "莱姆 索拉里斯" --source zlib --lang chinese --limit 5
```

**Output** (JSON to stdout):
```json
{
  "source": "zlib",
  "count": 5,
  "books": [
    {
      "source": "zlib",
      "id": "12345",
      "hash": "abc123def",
      "title": "Deep Learning",
      "author": "Ian Goodfellow",
      "year": "2016",
      "language": "english",
      "extension": "pdf",
      "filesize": "22.5 MB"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Present Results to User

After searching, present results as a **numbered table** so the user can pick:

```
| # | Title | Author | Year | Format | Size |
|---|-------|--------|------|--------|------|
| 1 | Deep Learning | Ian Goodfellow | 2016 | pdf | 22.5 MB |
| 2 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

If results span multiple languages or editions, **group them by language or category** with sub-headings for clarity.

Ask: "Which book would you like to download? (number)"

### 3. Download

```bash
# Z-Library download (needs id + hash from search results)
python3 ${SKILL_PATH}/scripts/book.py download --source zlib --id 12345 --hash abc123def -o ~/Downloads/

# Anna's Archive download (needs MD5 hash from search results)
python3 ${SKILL_PATH}/scripts/book.py download --source annas --hash a1b2c3d4e5 --filename "deep_learning.pdf" -o ~/Downloads/
```

**Output**:
```json
{
  "source": "zlib",
  "status": "ok",
  "path": "/Users/user/Downloads/Deep Learning (Ian Goodfellow).pdf",
  "size": 23592960
}
```

### 4. Report to User

After download, report:
- File path (so user can open it)
- File size
- Any remaining download quota (Z-Library has daily limits)

## Other Commands

### Book Info (Z-Library only)

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_PATH}/scripts/book.py info --source zlib --id 12345 --hash abc123def
```

Returns full metadata: description, ISBN, pages, table of contents, etc.

### Check Config

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_PATH}/scripts/book.py config show
```

### Check Backend Status

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_PATH}/scripts/book.py setup
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| "Z-Library not configured" | No credentials | Guide user to edit `~/.claude/book-tools/.env` |
| "Z-Library login failed" | Bad credentials or service down | Ask user to verify credentials. Z-Library domains change — if persistent, the vendored `Zlibrary.py` domain may need updating. |
| "annas-mcp binary not found" | Binary not installed | Run `setup.sh install-annas` |
| "Anna's Archive API key not configured" | No API key | Guide user to donate at Anna's Archive for API access, then add key to `.env` |
| Search timeout | Network issue | Retry once. If persistent, try the other backend. |
| "No backend available" | Neither backend configured | Walk through full setup flow from Step 1 |

## Tips

- Z-Library has a daily download limit (usually 10/day for free accounts). Use `info` to check a book before downloading to avoid wasting quota.
- Anna's Archive requires an API key for both search and download (obtained via donation).
- For Chinese books, use `--lang chinese` with Z-Library for best results.
- If Z-Library is unreachable, automatically fall back to Anna's Archive with `--source auto`.
- When searching for a specific author in multiple languages, run parallel searches (e.g. English name + Chinese name) and merge results into one table.
